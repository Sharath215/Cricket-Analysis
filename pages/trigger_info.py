    st.subheader("üèè What is Trigger Movement?")
    st.write("""
    In cricket, trigger movement refers to the small foot movements a batsman makes just before the bowler releases the ball. 
    These movements help maintain balance, improve shot execution, and adapt to different types of deliveries. 
    A well-timed trigger movement ensures the batsman is in sync with the bowler‚Äôs rhythm, enhancing their ability 
    to react to swing, seam, or pace effectively.

        <li><b>Second Trigger Movement:</b> The final adjustment as the ball is released to react to swing, seam, or bounce.</li>

    st.write("""
    Every batsman has a unique trigger movement that works best for them because apart from foot movement, 
    many factors influence batting performance. A batsman has only a split second to make a decision, 
    and the trigger movement helps align them to play the ball effectively.

    In this project, I have collected images of batsmen at the five key steps of trigger movement over the years.  
    - **Virat Kohli (2020-2025):** During this period, Kohli faced challenges in Test cricket.  
      To analyze his struggles, I gathered images of his trigger movements from these years and trained a model.  
    - **Joe Root (2020-2025):** In contrast, Root was in a golden phase, consistently scoring centuries.  
      Using the same methodology, I captured his trigger movements to understand what made his technique successful.

    By comparing these two players, we gain insight into how small adjustments in trigger movement 
    can impact a batsman‚Äôs success at the highest level.
